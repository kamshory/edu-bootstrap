case 12:{?>Verily We created man from a product of wet earth;<?php break;}
case 13:{?>Then placed him as a drop ( of seed ) in a safe lodging;<?php break;}
case 14:{?>Then fashioned We the drop a clot, then fashioned We the clot a little lump, then fashioned We the little lump bones, then clothed the bones with flesh, and then produced it another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators!<?php break;}
case 15:{?>Then lo! after that ye surely die.<?php break;}
case 16:{?>Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection ye are raced ( again ).<?php break;}
case 17:{?>And We have created above you seven paths, and We are never unmindful of creation.<?php break;}
case 18:{?>And We send down from the sky water in measure, and We give it lodging in the earth, and lo! We are able to withdraw It.<?php break;}

case 20:{?>And a tree that springeth forth from Mount Sinai that groweth oil and relish for the eaters.<?php break;}
case 21:{?>And lo! in the cattle there is verily a lesson for you. We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, and many uses have ye in them, and of them do ye eat;<?php break;}
case 22:{?>And on them and on the ship ye are carried.<?php break;}
case 23:{?>And We verily sent Noah unto his folk, and he said : O my people! Serve Allah. Ye have no other god save Him. Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 24:{?>But the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved, said : This is only a mortal like you who would make himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He surely could have sent down angels. We heard not of this in the case of our fathers of old.<?php break;}
case 25:{?>He is only a man in whom is a madness, so watch him for a while.<?php break;}
case 26:{?>He said : My Lord! Help me because they deny me.<?php break;}
case 27:{?>Then We inspired in him, saying : Make the ship under Our eyes and Our inspiration. Then, when Our command cometh and the oven gusheth water, introduce therein of every ( kind ) two spouses, and thy household save him thereof against whom the Word hath already gone forth. And plead not with Me on behalf of those who have done wrong : Lo! they will be drowned.<?php break;}
case 28:{?>And when thou art on board the ship, thou and whoso is with thee, then say : Praise be to Allah Who hath saved us from the wrongdoing folk!<?php break;}
case 29:{?>And say : My Lord! Cause me to land at a blessed landing place, for Thou art best of all who bring to land.<?php break;}
case 30:{?>Lo! herein verily are portents, for lo! We are ever putting ( mankind ) to the test.<?php break;}
case 31:{?>Then, after them, We brought forth another generation;<?php break;}
case 32:{?>And We sent among them a messenger of their own saying : Serve Allah. Ye have no other god save Him. Will ye not warn off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 33:{?>And the chieftains of his folk, who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, and whom We had made soft in the life of the world, said : This is only a mortal like you, who eateth of that whereof ye eat and drinketh of that ye drink.<?php break;}
case 34:{?>If ye were to obey a mortal like yourselves, ye surely would be losers.<?php break;}
case 35:{?>Doth he promise you that you, when ye are dead and have become dust and bones, will ( again ) be brought forth?<?php break;}
case 36:{?>Begone, begone, with that which ye are promised!<?php break;}
case 37:{?>There is naught but our life of the world; we die and we live, and we shall not be raised ( again ).<?php break;}
case 38:{?>He is only a man who hath invented a lie about Allah. We are not going to put faith in him.<?php break;}
case 39:{?>He said : My Lord! Help me because they deny me,<?php break;}
case 40:{?>He said : In a little while they surely will become repentant.<?php break;}
case 41:{?>So the ( Awful ) Cry overtook them rightfully, and We made them like as wreckage ( that a torrent hurleth ). A far removal for wrongdoing folk!<?php break;}
case 42:{?>Then after them We brought forth other generations.<?php break;}
case 43:{?>No nation can outstrip its term, nor yet postpone it.<?php break;}
case 44:{?>Then We sent our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto a nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another ( to disaster ) and We made them bywords. A far removal for folk who believe not!<?php break;}
case 45:{?>Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our tokens and a clear warrant<?php break;}
case 46:{?>Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they scorned ( them ) and they were despotic folk.<?php break;}
case 47:{?>And they said : Shall we put faith in two mortals like ourselves, and whose folk are servile unto us?<?php break;}
case 48:{?>So they denied them, and became of those who were destroyed.<?php break;}
case 49:{?>And we verily gave Moses the Scripture, that haply they might go aright.<?php break;}
case 50:{?>And We made the son of Mary and his mother a portent, and We gave them refuge on a height, a place of flocks and water springs.<?php break;}
case 51:{?>O ye messengers! Eat of the good thing, and do right. Lo! I am Aware of what ye do.<?php break;}
case 52:{?>And lo! this your religion is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your duty unto Me.<?php break;}
case 53:{?>But they ( mankind ) have broken their religion among them into sects, each sect rejoicing in its tenets.<?php break;}
case 54:{?>So leave them in their error till a time.<?php break;}
case 55:{?>Think they that in the wealth and sons wherewith We provide them<?php break;}
case 56:{?>We hasten unto them with good things? Nay, but they perceive not.<?php break;}
case 57:{?>Lo! those who go in awe for fear of their Lord,<?php break;}
case 58:{?>And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord,<?php break;}
case 59:{?>And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord,<?php break;}
case 60:{?>And those who give that which they give with hearts afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord,<?php break;}
case 61:{?>These race for the good things, and they shall win them in the race.<?php break;}
case 62:{?>And We task not any soul beyond its scope, and with Us is a Record which speaketh the truth, and they will not be wronged.<?php break;}
case 63:{?>Nay, but their hearts are in ignorance of this ( Quran ), and they have other works, besides, which they are doing;<?php break;}
case 64:{?>Till when We grasp their luxurious ones with the punishment, behold! they supplicate.<?php break;}
case 65:{?>Supplicate not this day! Assuredly ye will not be helped by Us.<?php break;}
case 66:{?>My revelations were recited unto you, but ye used to turn back on your heels,<?php break;}
case 67:{?>In scorn thereof. Nightly did ye rave together.<?php break;}
case 68:{?>Have they not pondered the Word, or hath that come unto them which came not unto their fathers of old?<?php break;}
case 69:{?>Or know they not their messenger, and so reject him?<?php break;}
case 70:{?>Or say they : There is a madness in him? Nay, but he bringeth them the Truth; and most of them are haters of the Truth.<?php break;}
case 71:{?>And if the Truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth and whosoever is therein had been corrupted. Nay, We have brought them their Reminder, but from their Reminder they now turn away.<?php break;}
case 72:{?>Or dost thou ask of them ( O Muhammad ) any tribute? But! the bounty of thy Lord is better, for He is best of all who make provision.<?php break;}
case 73:{?>And lo! thou summonest them indeed unto a right path.<?php break;}
case 74:{?>And lo! those who believe not in the Hereafter are indeed astray from the path.<?php break;}
case 75:{?>Though We had mercy on them and relieved them of the harm afflicting them, they still would wander blindly on in their contumacy.<?php break;}
case 76:{?>Already have We grasped them with punishment, but they humble not themselves unto their Lord, nor do they pray,<?php break;}
case 77:{?>Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme punishment, behold! they are aghast thereat.<?php break;}
case 78:{?>He it is Who hath created for you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye!<?php break;}
case 79:{?>And He it is Who hath sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him ye will be gathered.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>And He it is Who giveth life and causeth death, and His is the difference of night and day. Have ye then no sense?<?php break;}
case 81:{?>Nay, but they say the like of that which said the men of old;<?php break;}
case 82:{?>They say : When we are dead and have become ( mere dust and bones, shall we then, forsooth, be raised again?<?php break;}
case 83:{?>We were already promised this, we and our forefathcrs. Lo! this is naught but fables of the men of old.<?php break;}
case 84:{?>Say : Unto Whom ( belongeth ) the earth and whosoever is therein, if ye have knowledge?<?php break;}
case 85:{?>They will say : Unto Allah. Say : Will ye not then remember?<?php break;}
case 86:{?>Say : Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Tremendous Throne?<?php break;}
case 87:{?>They will say : Unto Allah ( all that belongeth ). Say : Will ye not then keep duty ( unto Him )?<?php break;}
case 88:{?>Say : In Whose hand is the dominion over all things and He protecteth, while against Him there is no protection, if ye have knowledge?<?php break;}
case 89:{?>They will say : Unto Allah ( all that belongeth ). Say : How then are ye bewitched?<?php break;}
case 90:{?>Nay, but We have brought them the Truth, and lo! they are liars.<?php break;}
case 91:{?>Allah hath not chosen any son, nor is there any God along with Him; else would each God have assuredly championed that which he created, and some of them would assuredly have overcome others. Glorified be Allah above all that they allege.<?php break;}
case 92:{?>Knower of the invisible and the visible! and exalted be He over all that they ascribe as partners ( unto Him )!<?php break;}
case 93:{?>Say : My Lord! If thou shouldst show me that which they are promised,<?php break;}
case 94:{?>My Lord! then set me not among the wrongdoing folk.<?php break;}
case 95:{?>And verily We are Able to show thee that which We have promised them.<?php break;}
case 96:{?>Repel evil with that which is better. We are best Aware of that which they allege.<?php break;}
case 97:{?>And say : My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from suggestions of the evil ones,<?php break;}
case 98:{?>And I seek refuge in Thee, my Lord, lest they be present with me,<?php break;}
case 99:{?>Until, when death cometh unto one of them, he saith : My Lord! Send me back,<?php break;}
case 100:{?>That I may do right in that which I have left behind! But nay! It is but a word that he speaketh; and behind them is a barrier until the day when they are raised.<?php break;}
case 101:{?>And when the trumpet is blown there will be no kinship among them that day, nor will they ask of one another.<?php break;}
case 102:{?>Then those whose scales are heavy, they are the successful.<?php break;}
case 103:{?>And those whose scales are light are those who lose their souls, in hell abiding.<?php break;}
case 104:{?>The fire burneth their faces, and they are glum therein.<?php break;}
case 105:{?>( It will be said ) : Were not My revelations recited unto you, and then ye used to deny them?<?php break;}
case 106:{?>They will say : Our Lord! Our evil fortune conquered us, and we were erring folk.<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Our Lord! Oh, bring us forth from hence! If we return ( to evil ) then indeed we shall be wrong doers.<?php break;}
case 108:{?>He saith : Begone therein, and speak not unto Me.<?php break;}
case 109:{?>Lo! there was a party of My slaves who said : Our Lord! We believe, therefor forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art best of all who show mercy;<?php break;}
case 110:{?>But ye chose them from a laughing stock until they caused you to forget remembrance of Me, while ye laughed at them.<?php break;}
case 111:{?>Lo! I have rewarded them this day forasmuch as they were steadfast; and they verily are the triumphant.<?php break;}
case 112:{?>He will say : How long tarried ye in the earth, counting by years?<?php break;}
case 113:{?>They will say : We tarried but a day or part of a day. Ask of those who keep count!<?php break;}
case 114:{?>He will say : Ye tarried but a little if ye only knew.<?php break;}
case 115:{?>Deemed ye then that We had created you for naught, and that ye would not be returned unto Us?<?php break;}
case 116:{?>Now Allah be exalted, the True King! There is no God save Him, the Lord of the Throne of Grace.<?php break;}
case 117:{?>He who crieth unto any other god along with Allah hath no proof thereof. His reckoning is only with his Lord. Lo! disbelievers will not be successful.<?php break;}
case 118:{?>And ( O Muhammad ) say : My Lord! Forgive and have mercy, for Thou art best of all who show mercy.<?php break;}
