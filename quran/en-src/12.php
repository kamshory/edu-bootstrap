case 27:{?>And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful.<?php break;}
case 28:{?>So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said : Lo! this is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great.<?php break;}
case 29:{?>O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, ( O woman ), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Lo! thou art of the sinful.<?php break;}

case 37:{?>He said : The food which ye are given ( daily ) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.<?php break;}
case 38:{?>And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the bounty of Allah unto us ( the seed of Abraham ) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks.<?php break;}

case 40:{?>Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not.<?php break;}

case 42:{?>And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released : Mention me in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he ( Joseph ) stayed in prison for some years.<?php break;}
case 43:{?>And the king said : Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other ( seven ) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams.<?php break;}

case 46:{?>( And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed ) : Joseph! O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other ( seven ) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know.<?php break;}
case 47:{?>He said : Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it in the ear, all save a little which ye eat.<?php break;}
case 48:{?>Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored.<?php break;}
case 49:{?>Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press ( wine and oil ).<?php break;}
case 50:{?>And the King said : Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him, he ( Joseph ) said : Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their. hands. Lo! my lord knoweth thee guile.<?php break;}
case 51:{?>He ( the king ) ( then sent for those women and ) said : What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph? They answered : Allah Blameless! We know no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler : Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the truthful.<?php break;}
case 52:{?>( Then Joseph said : I asked for ) this, that he ( my lord ) may now that I betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers.<?php break;}
case 53:{?>I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the ( human ) soul enjoineth unto evil, save that whereon my Lord hath mercy. my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.<?php break;}
case 54:{?>And the king said : Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person. And when he had talked with him he said : Lo! thou art today our presence established and trusts<?php break;}
case 55:{?>He said : Set me over the storehouses of the land I am a skilled custodian.<?php break;}
case 56:{?>Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where be pleased. We reach with our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the good.<?php break;}
case 57:{?>And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward of ( evil ).<?php break;}
case 58:{?>And Joseph ' s brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he knew them but they knew him not.<?php break;}
case 59:{?>And when he provided them with their provision he said : Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the best of hosts?<?php break;}
case 60:{?>And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with me, nor shall ye draw near.<?php break;}
case 61:{?>They said : We will try to win him from his father : that we will surely do.<?php break;}
case 62:{?>He said unto his young men : Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again.<?php break;}
case 63:{?>So when they went back to their father they said : O our father! The measure is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely we will guard him well.<?php break;}
case 64:{?>He said : Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.<?php break;}
case 65:{?>And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said : O our father! What ( more ) can we ask? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel ( load ). This ( that we bring now ) is a light measure.<?php break;}
case 66:{?>He said : I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of Allah that ye will bring him hack to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when they gave him their undertaking he said : Allah is the Warden over what we say.<?php break;}
case 67:{?>And he said : O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.<?php break;}
case 68:{?>And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob ' s soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.<?php break;}
case 69:{?>And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto himself, saying : Lo; I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did.<?php break;}
case 70:{?>And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking cup in his brother ' s saddlebag, and then a crier cried : O camel riders! Ye are surely thieves!<?php break;}
case 71:{?>They cried, coming toward them : What is it ye have lost?<?php break;}
case 72:{?>They said : We have lost the king ' s cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel load, and I ( said Joseph ) am answerable for it.<?php break;}
case 73:{?>They said : By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves.<?php break;}
case 74:{?>They said : And what shall be the penalty for it if ye prove liars?<?php break;}
case 75:{?>They said : The penalty for it! He in whose bag ( the cup ) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrongdoers.<?php break;}
case 76:{?>Then he ( Joseph ) began the search with their bags before his brother ' s bag, then he produced it from his brother ' s bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the king ' s law unless Allah willed. We raise by grades ( of mercy ) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing.<?php break;}
case 77:{?>They said : If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said ( within himself ) : Ye are in worse case and Allah knoweth best ( the truth of ) that which ye allege.<?php break;}
case 78:{?>They said : O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath an aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness.<?php break;}
case 79:{?>He said : Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrongdoers.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>So, when they despaired of ( moving ) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said : Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah ' s name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges.<?php break;}
case 81:{?>Return unto your father and say : O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the unseen.<?php break;}
case 82:{?>Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth.<?php break;}
case 83:{?>( And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him ) he said : Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. ( My course is ) comely patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise.<?php break;}
case 84:{?>And he turned away from them and said : Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing.<?php break;}
case 85:{?>They said : By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!<?php break;}
case 86:{?>He said : I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not.<?php break;}
case 87:{?>Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving folk<?php break;}
case 88:{?>And when they came ( again ) before him ( Joseph ) they said : O ruler! Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the charitable.<?php break;}
case 89:{?>He said : Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance?<?php break;}
case 90:{?>They said : Is it indeed thou who art Joseph? He said : I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah hath shown us favor. Lo! he who wardeth off ( evil ) and endureth ( findeth favor ); for verily Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly.<?php break;}
case 91:{?>They said : By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were indeed sinful.<?php break;}
case 92:{?>He said : Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.<?php break;}
case 93:{?>Go with this shirt of mine and lay it on my father ' s face, he will become ( again ) a seer; and come to me with all your folk.<?php break;}
case 94:{?>When the caravan departed their father had said : Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard.<?php break;}
case 95:{?>( Those around him ) said : By Allah, Lo! thou art in thine old aberration.<?php break;}
case 96:{?>Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more. He said : Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not?<?php break;}
case 97:{?>They said : O our father! Ask forgiveness of our sins for us, for lo! we were sinful.<?php break;}
case 98:{?>He said : I shall ask forgiveness for you of my Lord. He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 99:{?>And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and said : Come into Egypt sale, if Allah will!<?php break;}
case 100:{?>And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate, and he said : O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the Wise.<?php break;}
case 101:{?>O my Lord! Thou hast given me ( something ) of sovereignty and hast taught me ( something ) of the interpretation of events, Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protecting Friend in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die submissive ( unto Thee ), and join me to the righteous.<?php break;}
case 102:{?>This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee ( Muhammad ). Thou waft not present with them when they bed their plan and they were scheming.<?php break;}
case 103:{?>And though thou try much, most men will not believe.<?php break;}
case 104:{?>Thou askest them no fee for it. It is naught else than a reminder unto the peoples.<?php break;}
case 105:{?>How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted!<?php break;}
case 106:{?>And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners ( unto Him ).<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah ' s punishment, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware?<?php break;}
case 108:{?>Say : This is my Way : I call on Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever followeth me Glory be to Allah! and I am not of the idolaters.<?php break;}
case 109:{?>We sent not before thee ( any messengers ) save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, for those who ward off ( evil ), is best. Have ye then no sense?<?php break;}
case 110:{?>Till, when the messengers despaired and thought that they were denied, then came unto them Our help, and whom We would was saved. And our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty.<?php break;}
case 111:{?>In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing ( Scripture ) and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.<?php break;}
