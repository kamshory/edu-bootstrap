case 79:{?>So. We took vengeance on them; and lo! they both are on a high road plain to see.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>And the dwellers in Al-Hijr indeed denied ( Our ) messengers.<?php break;}
case 81:{?>And We gave them Our revelations, but they were averse to them.<?php break;}
case 82:{?>And they used to hew out dwellings from the hills, ( wherein they dwelt ) secure.<?php break;}
case 83:{?>But the ( Awful ) Cry overtook them at the morning hour,<?php break;}
case 84:{?>And that which they were wont to count as gain availed them not.<?php break;}
