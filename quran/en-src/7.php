He will enjoin on them that which is right and forbid them that which is wrong. He will make lawful for them all good things and prohibit for them only the foul; and he will relieve them of their burden and the fetters that they used to wear.

So believe in Allah and His messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believeth in Allah and in His words and follow him that haply ye may be led aright.<?php break;}
case 159:{?>And of Moses ' folk there is a community who lead with truth and establish justice therewith.<?php break;}
case 160:{?>We divided them into twelve tribes, nations; and We inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying : Smite with thy staff the rock! And there gushed forth therefrom twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinking place. And we caused the white cloud to overshadow them and sent down for them the manna and the quails ( saying ) : Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you. They wronged Us not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.<?php break;}

case 163:{?>Ask them ( O Muhammad ) of the township that was by the sea, how they did break the sabbath, how their big fish came unto them visibly upon their sabbath day and on a day when they did not keep sabbath came they not unto them. Thus did We try them for that they were evil livers.<?php break;}
case 164:{?>And when a community among them said : Why preach ye to a folk whom Allah is about to destroy and punish with an awful doom, they said : In order to be free from guilt before your Lord, and that haply they may ward off ( evil ).<?php break;}

And if there came to them ( again ) the offer of the like, they would accept it ( and would sin again ). Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the truth? And they have studied that which is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better, for those who ward off ( evil ). Have ye then no sense?<?php break;}
