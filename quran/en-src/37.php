case 85:{?>When he said unto his father and his folk : What is it that ye worship?<?php break;}
case 86:{?>Is it a falsehood gods beside Allah that ye desire?<?php break;}
case 87:{?>What then is your opinion of the Lord of the Worlds?<?php break;}
case 88:{?>And he glanced a glance at the stars<?php break;}

case 91:{?>Then turned he to their gods and said : Will ye not eat?<?php break;}
case 92:{?>What aileth you that ye speak not?<?php break;}
case 93:{?>Then he attacked them, striking with his right hand.<?php break;}
case 94:{?>And ( his people ) came toward him, hastening.<?php break;}
case 95:{?>He said : Worship ye that which ye yourselves do carve<?php break;}
case 96:{?>When Allah hath created you and what ye make?<?php break;}
case 97:{?>They said : Build for him a building and fling him in the red hot fire.<?php break;}
case 98:{?>And they designed a snare for him, but We made them the undermost.<?php break;}
case 99:{?>And he said : Lo! I am going unto my Lord Who will guide me<?php break;}

case 103:{?>Then, when they had both surrendered ( to Allah ), and he had flung him down upon his face,<?php break;}
case 104:{?>We called unto him : O Abraham :<?php break;}
case 105:{?>Thou hast already fulfilled the vision. Lo! thus do We reward the good.<?php break;}
case 106:{?>Lo! that verily was a clear test.<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Then We ransomed him with a tremendous victim.<?php break;}
case 108:{?>And We left for him among the later folk ( the salutation ) :<?php break;}
case 109:{?>Peace be unto Abraham!<?php break;}
case 110:{?>Thus do We reward the good.<?php break;}
case 111:{?>Lo! he is one of Our believing slaves.<?php break;}
case 112:{?>And We gave him tidings of the birth of Isaac, a Prophet of the righteous.<?php break;}
case 113:{?>And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their seed are some who do good, and some who plainly wrong themselves.<?php break;}
case 114:{?>And We verily gave grace unto Moses and Aaron,<?php break;}
case 115:{?>And saved them and their people from the great distress,<?php break;}
case 116:{?>And helped them so that they became the victors.<?php break;}
case 117:{?>And We gave them the clear Scripture<?php break;}
case 118:{?>And showed them the right path.<?php break;}
case 119:{?>And We left for them, among the later folk ( the salutation ) :<?php break;}
case 120:{?>Peace be unto Moses and Aaron!<?php break;}
case 121:{?>Lo! thus do We reward the good.<?php break;}
case 122:{?>Lo! they are two of our believing slaves.<?php break;}
case 123:{?>And lo! Elias was of those sent ( to warn )<?php break;}
case 124:{?>When he said unto his folk : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 125:{?>Will ye cry unto Baal and forsake the best of Creators,<?php break;}
case 126:{?>Allah, your Lord and Lord of your forefathers?<?php break;}
case 127:{?>But they denied him, so they surely will be haled forth ( to the doom )<?php break;}
case 128:{?>Save single minded slaves of Allah.<?php break;}
case 129:{?>And we left for him among the later folk ( the salutation ) :<?php break;}
case 130:{?>Peace be unto Elias!<?php break;}
case 131:{?>Lo! thus do We reward the good.<?php break;}
case 132:{?>Lo! he is one of our believing slaves.<?php break;}
case 133:{?>And lo! Lot verily was of those sent ( to warn ),<?php break;}
case 134:{?>When We saved him and his household, every one,<?php break;}
case 135:{?>Save an old woman among those who stayed behind;<?php break;}
case 136:{?>Then We destroyed the others.<?php break;}
case 137:{?>And Lo! ye verily pass by ( the ruin of ) them in the morning<?php break;}
case 138:{?>And at night time; have ye then no sense?<?php break;}
case 139:{?>And lo! Jonah verily was of those sent ( to warn )<?php break;}
case 140:{?>When he fled unto the laden ship,<?php break;}
case 141:{?>And then drew lots and was of those rejected;<?php break;}
case 142:{?>And the fish swallowed him while be was blameworthy;<?php break;}
case 143:{?>And had he not been one of those who glorify ( Allah )<?php break;}
case 144:{?>He would have tarried in its belly till the day when they are raised;<?php break;}
case 145:{?>Then We cast him on a desert shore while he was sick;<?php break;}
case 146:{?>And We caused a tree of gourd to grow above him;<?php break;}
case 147:{?>And We sent him to a hundred thousand ( folk ) or more<?php break;}
case 148:{?>And they believed, therefor We gave them comfort for a while.<?php break;}
case 149:{?>Now ask them ( O Muhammad ) : Hath thy Lord daughters whereas they have sons?<?php break;}
case 150:{?>Or created We the angels females while they were present?<?php break;}
case 151:{?>Lo! it is of their falsehood that they say :<?php break;}
case 152:{?>Allah hath begotten. And lo! verily they tell a lie.<?php break;}
case 153:{?>( And again of their falsehood ) : He hath preferred daughters to sons<?php break;}
case 154:{?>What aileth you? How judge ye?<?php break;}
case 155:{?>Will ye not then reflect?<?php break;}
case 156:{?>Or have ye a clear warrant?<?php break;}
case 157:{?>Then produce your writ, if ye are truthful.<?php break;}
case 158:{?>And they imagine kinship between him and the jinn, whereas the jinn know well that they will be brought before ( Him ).<?php break;}
case 159:{?>Glorified be Allah from that which they attribute ( unto Him ),<?php break;}
case 160:{?>Save single minded slaves of Allah.<?php break;}
case 161:{?>Lo! verily, ye and that which ye worship,<?php break;}
case 162:{?>Ye cannot excite ( anyone ) against Him<?php break;}
case 163:{?>Save him who is to burn in hell.<?php break;}
case 164:{?>There is not one of Us but hath his known position.<?php break;}
case 165:{?>Lo! We, even We are they who set the ranks.<?php break;}
case 166:{?>Lo! We, even We are they who hymn His praise<?php break;}
case 167:{?>And indeed they used to say :<?php break;}
case 168:{?>If we had but a reminder from the men of old<?php break;}
case 169:{?>We would be single minded slaves of Allah.<?php break;}
case 170:{?>Yet ( now that it is come ) the, disbelieve therein : but they will come to know.<?php break;}
case 171:{?>And verily Our word went forth of old unto Our bondmen sent ( to warn )<?php break;}
case 172:{?>That they verily would be helped,<?php break;}
case 173:{?>And that Our host, they verily would be the victors.<?php break;}
case 174:{?>So withdraw from them ( O Muhammad ) awhile,<?php break;}
case 175:{?>And watch, for they will ( soon ) see.<?php break;}
case 176:{?>Would they hasten on Our doom?<?php break;}
case 177:{?>But when it cometh home to them, then it will be a hapless morn for those who have been warned.<?php break;}
case 178:{?>Withdraw from them awhile<?php break;}
case 179:{?>And watch, for they will ( soon ) see.<?php break;}
case 180:{?>Glorified be thy Lord, the Lord of Majesty, from that which they attribute ( unto Him )<?php break;}
case 181:{?>And peace be unto those sent ( to warn ).<?php break;}
