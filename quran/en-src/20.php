case 55:{?>Thereof We created you, and thereunto we return you and thence We bring you forth a second time.<?php break;}
case 56:{?>And We verily did show him all Our tokens, but he denied them and refused.<?php break;}
case 57:{?>He said : Hast come to drive us out from our land by thy magic, O Moses?<?php break;}
case 58:{?>But we surely can produce magic the like thereof; so appoint a tryst between us and you, which neither we nor thou shall fail to keep, at a place convenient ( to us both ).<?php break;}
case 59:{?>( Moses ) said : Your tryst shall be the day of the feast, and let the people assemble when the sun hath risen high.<?php break;}

case 61:{?>Moses said unto them : Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He extirpate you by some punishment. He who lieth faileth miserably.<?php break;}

case 63:{?>They said : Lo! these are two wizards who would drive you out from your country by their magic, and destroy your best traditions;<?php break;}
case 64:{?>So arrange your plan, and come in battle line. Whoso is uppermost this day will be indeed successful.<?php break;}

case 68:{?>We said : Fear not! Lo! thou art the higher.<?php break;}
case 69:{?>Throw that which is in thy right hand! It will eat up that which they have made. Lo! that which they have made but a wizards artifice, and a wizard shall not be successful to whatever point ( of skill ) he may attain.<?php break;}

case 71:{?>( Pharaoh ) said : Ye put faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he is your chief who taught you magic. Now surely I shall cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and I shall crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and ye shall know for certain which of us hath sterner and more lasting punishment.<?php break;}
case 72:{?>They said : We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us, and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for us only the life of the world.<?php break;}
case 73:{?>Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting.<?php break;}
case 74:{?>Lo! whoso cometh guilty unto his Lord, verily for him is hell. There he will neither die nor live.<?php break;}
case 75:{?>But whoso cometh unto Him a believer, having done good works, for such are the high stations;<?php break;}
case 76:{?>Gardens of Eden underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of him who groweth.<?php break;}
case 77:{?>And verily We inspired Moses, saying : Take away My slaves by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid ( of the sea ).<?php break;}
case 78:{?>Then Pharaoh followed with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea.<?php break;}
case 79:{?>And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and We made a covenant with you on the holy mountain ' s side, and sent down on you the manna and the quails,<?php break;}
case 81:{?>( Saying ) : Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you; and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.<?php break;}
case 82:{?>And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and doeth good, and afterward walketh aright.<?php break;}
case 83:{?>And ( it was said ) : What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses?<?php break;}
case 84:{?>He said : They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee that Thou mightest be well pleased.<?php break;}
case 85:{?>He said : Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As-Samiri hath misled thee<?php break;}
case 86:{?>Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad He said : O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise? Did the time appointed then appear too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you, that ye broke tryst with me?<?php break;}
case 87:{?>They said : We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them ( in the fire ), for thus As-Samiri proposed<?php break;}
case 88:{?>Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried : This is your God and the God of Moses, but he hath forgotten.<?php break;}
case 89:{?>See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use?<?php break;}
case 90:{?>And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand : O my people! Ye are but being seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my order.<?php break;}
case 91:{?>They said : We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return unto us.<?php break;}
case 92:{?>He ( Moses ) said : O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray,<?php break;}
case 93:{?>That thou followedst me not? Hast thou then disobeyed my order?<?php break;}
case 94:{?>He said : O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest thou shouldst say : Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and hast not waited for my word.<?php break;}
case 95:{?>( Moses ) said : And what has thou to say, O Samiri?<?php break;}
case 96:{?>He said : I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me.<?php break;}
case 97:{?>( Moses ) said : Then go! And lo! in this life it is for thee to say : Touch me not! and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea.<?php break;}
case 98:{?>Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God He embraceth all things in His knowledge.<?php break;}
case 99:{?>Thus relate Who unto thee ( Muhammad ) some tidings of that which happened of old, and We have given thee from Our presence a Reminder.<?php break;}
case 100:{?>Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection,<?php break;}
case 101:{?>Abiding under it an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,<?php break;}
case 102:{?>The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty white eyed ( with terror ),<?php break;}
case 103:{?>Murmuring among themselves : Ye have tarried but ten ( days ).<?php break;}
case 104:{?>We are best aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say : Ye have tarried but a day.<?php break;}
case 105:{?>They will ask thee of the mountains ( on that day ). Say : My Lord will break them into scattered dust.<?php break;}
case 106:{?>And leave it as an empty plain,<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness.<?php break;}
case 108:{?>On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur.<?php break;}
case 109:{?>On that Day no intercession availeth save ( that of ) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave and whose He accepteth :<?php break;}
case 110:{?>He knoweth ( all ) that is before them and ( all ) that is behind them, while they cannot compass it in knowledge.<?php break;}
case 111:{?>And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who beareth ( a burden of ) wrongdoing is indeed a failure ( on that Day ).<?php break;}
case 112:{?>And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not injustice nor begrudging ( of his wage ).<?php break;}
case 113:{?>Thus We have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed.<?php break;}
case 114:{?>Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not ( O Muhammad ) with the Quran ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say : My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.<?php break;}
case 115:{?>And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him.<?php break;}
case 116:{?>And when We said unto the angels : Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate ( all ) save Iblis; he refused.<?php break;}
case 117:{?>Therefor We said : O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil.<?php break;}
case 118:{?>It is ( vouchsafed ) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked,<?php break;}
case 119:{?>And thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun ' s heat.<?php break;}
case 120:{?>But the Devil whispered to him, saying : O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away?<?php break;}
case 121:{?>Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them, and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray.<?php break;}
case 122:{?>Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him.<?php break;}
case 123:{?>He said : Go down hence, both of you, one of you a foe unto the other. But if there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance, he will not go astray nor come to grief.<?php break;}
case 124:{?>But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life, and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.<?php break;}
case 125:{?>He will say : My Lord! Wherefore hast Thou gathered me ( hither ) blind, when I was wont to see?<?php break;}
case 126:{?>He will say : So ( it must be ). Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day.<?php break;}
case 127:{?>Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.<?php break;}
case 128:{?>Is it not a guidance for them ( to know ) how many a generation We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk? Lo! therein verily are signs for men of thought.<?php break;}
case 129:{?>And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would ( have ) been inevitable ( in this world ).<?php break;}
case 130:{?>Therefor ( O Muhammad ), bear with what they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find acceptance.<?php break;}
case 131:{?>And strain not thine eyes toward that which We cause some wedded pairs among them to enjoy, the flower of the life of the world, that We may try them thereby. The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting.<?php break;}
case 132:{?>And enjoin upon thy people worship, and be constant therein. We ask not of thee a provision : We provide for thee. And the sequel is for righteousness.<?php break;}
case 133:{?>And they say : If only he would bring us a miracle from his Lord! Hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former Scriptures?<?php break;}
case 134:{?>And if We had destroyed them with some punishment before it, they would assuredly have said : Our Lord! If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were ( thus ) humbled and disgraced!<?php break;}
case 135:{?>Say : Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity, and who is right.<?php break;}
