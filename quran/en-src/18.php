case 1:{?>Praise be to Allah Who hath revealed the Scripture unto His slave, and hath not placed therein any crookedness,<?php break;}
case 2:{?>( But hath made it ) straight, to give warning of stem punishment from Him, and to bring unto the believers who do good works the news that theirs will be a fair reward.<?php break;}
case 3:{?>Wherein they will abide for ever;<?php break;}
case 4:{?>And to warn those who say : Allah hath chosen a son,<?php break;}
case 5:{?>( A thing ) whereof they have no knowledge, nor ( had ) thee fathers. Dreadful is the word that cometh out of their mouths. They speak naught but a lie.<?php break;}
case 6:{?>Yet it may be, if they believe not in this statement, that thou ( Muhammad ) wilt torment thy soul with grief over their footsteps.<?php break;}
case 7:{?>Lo! We have placed all that is in the earth as an ornament thereof that we may try them : which of them is best in conduct.<?php break;}
case 8:{?>And lo! We shall make all that is therein a barren mound.<?php break;}
case 9:{?>Or deemest thou that the People of the Cave and the Inscription are a wonder among Our portents?<?php break;}
case 10:{?>When the young men Red for refuge to the Cave and said : Our Lord! Give us mercy from Thy presence and shape for us right conduct in our plight<?php break;}
case 11:{?>Then We sealed up their hearing in the Cave for a number of years.<?php break;}
case 12:{?>And afterward We raised them up that We might know which of the two parties would best calculate the time that they had tarried.<?php break;}
case 13:{?>We narrate unto thee their story with truth. Lo! they were young men who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance.<?php break;}
case 14:{?>And We made firm their hearts when they stood forth and said : Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We cry unto no god beside Him, for then should we utter an enormity.<?php break;}
case 15:{?>These, our people, have chosen ( other ) gods beside Him though they bring no clear warrant ( vouchsafed ) to them. And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah?<?php break;}
case 16:{?>And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight.<?php break;}
case 17:{?>And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. That was ( one ) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend.<?php break;}
case 18:{?>And thou wouldst have deemed them waking thou they were asleep, and we caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them.<?php break;}
case 19:{?>And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said : How long have ye tarried? They said : We have tarried a day or some part of a day, ( Others ) said : Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you.<?php break;}
case 20:{?>For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you back to their religion; then ye will never prosper.<?php break;}
case 21:{?>And in like manner We disclosed them ( to the people of the city ) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When ( the people of the city ) disputed of their case among themselves, they said : Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said : We verity shall build a place of worship over them.<?php break;}
case 22:{?>( Some ) will say : They were three, their dog the fourth, and ( some ) say : Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and ( some ) say : Seven, and their dog the eighth. Say ( O Muhammad ) : My Lord is best aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them.<?php break;}
case 23:{?>And say not of anything : Lo! I shall do that tomorrow,<?php break;}
case 24:{?>Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say : It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this.<?php break;}
case 25:{?>And ( it is said ) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine.<?php break;}
case 26:{?>Say : Allah is best aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government.<?php break;}
case 27:{?>And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him.<?php break;}
case 28:{?>Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned.<?php break;}
case 29:{?>Say : ( It is ) the truth from the Lord of you ( all ). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting place!<?php break;}
case 30:{?>Lo! as for those who believe and do good works, Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost.<?php break;}
case 31:{?>As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon thrones therein. Blest the reward, and fair the resting place!<?php break;}
case 32:{?>Coin for them a similitude : Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date palms and had put between them tillage.<?php break;}
case 33:{?>Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein.<?php break;}
case 34:{?>And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him : I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men.<?php break;}
case 35:{?>And he went into his garden, while he ( thus ) wronged himself. He said : I think not that all this will ever perish.<?php break;}
case 36:{?>I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort.<?php break;}
case 37:{?>And his comrade, while he disputed with him, ex claimed : Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop ( of seed ), and then fashioned thee a man?<?php break;}
case 38:{?>But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner.<?php break;}
case 39:{?>If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said : That which Allah wilteth ( will come to pass )! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children.<?php break;}
case 40:{?>Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside,<?php break;}
case 41:{?>Or some morning the water thereof will he lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it.<?php break;}
case 42:{?>And his fruit was beset ( with destruction ). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it, when ( now ) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say : Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!<?php break;}
case 43:{?>And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save himself.<?php break;}
case 44:{?>In this case is protection only from Allah, the True. He is best for reward, and best for consequence.<?php break;}
case 45:{?>And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is Able to do all things.<?php break;}
case 46:{?>Wealth and children are an ornament of life of the world. But the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord ' s sight for reward, and better in respect of hope.<?php break;}
case 47:{?>And ( bethink you of ) the Day when We remove the hills and ye see the earth emerging, and We gather them together so as to leave not one of them behind.<?php break;}
case 48:{?>And they are set before thy Lord in ranks ( and it is said unto them ) : Now verily have ye come unto Us as We created you at the first. But ye thought that We had set no tryst for you.<?php break;}
case 49:{?>And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein, and they say : What Kind of a book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it! And they find all that they did confronting them, and thy Lord wrongeth no one.<?php break;}
case 50:{?>And ( remember ) when We said unto the angels : Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Ibis. He was of the Jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord ' s command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you? Calamitous is the exchange for evil doers!<?php break;}
case 51:{?>I made them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor their own creation; nor choose I misleaders for ( My ) helpers.<?php break;}
case 52:{?>And ( be mindful of ) the Day when He will say : Call those partners of Mine whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer, and We shall set a gulf of doom between them.<?php break;}
case 53:{?>And the guilty behold the Fire and know that they are about to fall therein, and they find no way of escape thence :<?php break;}
case 54:{?>And verily We have displayed for mankind in this Quran all manner of similitudes, but man is more than anything contentious.<?php break;}
case 55:{?>And naught hindereth mankind from believing when the guidance cometh unto them, and from asking for forgiveness of their Lord, unless ( it be that they wish ) that the judgment of the men of old should come upon them or ( that ) they should be confronted with the Doom.<?php break;}
case 56:{?>We send not the messengers save as bearers of good news and warners. Those who disbelieve contend with falsehood in order to refute the Truth thereby. And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest<?php break;}
case 57:{?>And who doth greater wrong than he who hath been reminded of the revelations of his Lord, yet turneth away from them and forgetteth what his hands send forward ( to the Judgment )? Lo! on their hearts We have placed coverings so that they understand not, and in their ears a deafness. And though thou call them to the guidance, in that case they can never be led aright.<?php break;}
case 58:{?>Thy Lord is the Forgiver, Full of Mercy. If He took them to task ( now ) for what they earn, He would hasten on the doom for them; but their is an appointed term from which they will find no escape<?php break;}
case 59:{?>And ( all ) those townships! We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.<?php break;}
case 60:{?>And when Moses said unto his servant : I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages.<?php break;}
case 61:{?>And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the waters, being free.<?php break;}
case 62:{?>And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant : Bring us our breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey.<?php break;}
case 63:{?>He said : Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the fish and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it, it took its way into the waters by a marvel.<?php break;}
case 64:{?>He said : This is that which we have been seeking they retraced their steps again.<?php break;}
case 65:{?>Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence.<?php break;}
case 66:{?>Moses said unto him : May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught?<?php break;}
case 67:{?>He said : Lo! thou canst not bear with me.<?php break;}
case 68:{?>How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge?<?php break;}
case 69:{?>He said : Allah willing, thou, shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught gainsay thee :<?php break;}
case 70:{?>He said : Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself mention of it unto thee.<?php break;}
case 71:{?>So the twain set out till, when they were in the ship, be made a hole therein. ( Moses ) said : Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof? Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing.<?php break;}
case 72:{?>He said : Did I not tell thee thou couldst not bear with me?<?php break;}
case 73:{?>( Moses ) said : Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my fault.<?php break;}
case 74:{?>So the twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. ( Moses ) said : What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing.<?php break;}
case 75:{?>He said : Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me? '<?php break;}
case 76:{?>( Moses ) said : If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company with. Thou hast received an excuse from me.<?php break;}
case 77:{?>So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests. And they found therein a wall upon the point of falling into ruin, and he repaired it. ( Moses ) said : If thou hadst wished, thou couldst have taken payment for it.<?php break;}
case 78:{?>He said : This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience.<?php break;}
case 79:{?>As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working on the river, and I wished to mar it, for there was a king behind them who is taking every ship by force.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>And as for the lad, his parents were believers and We feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief.<?php break;}
case 81:{?>And We intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy.<?php break;}
case 82:{?>And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure belonging to them and their father had been righteous, and thy Lord intended that they should come to their full strength and should bring forth their treasure as a mercy from their Lord; and I did it not upon my own command. Such is the interpretation of that wherewith thou couldst not bear.<?php break;}
case 83:{?>They will ask thee of Dhul-Qarneyn. Say : I shall recite unto you a remembrance of him.<?php break;}
case 84:{?>Lo! We made him strong in the land and gave unto every thing a road.<?php break;}
case 85:{?>And he followed a road<?php break;}
case 86:{?>Till, when he reached the setting place of the sun, he found it setting in a muddy spring, and found a people thereabout : We said : O Dhul-Qarneyn! Either punish or show them kindness.<?php break;}
case 87:{?>He said : As for him who doeth wrong, we shall punish him, and then he will be brought back unto, his Lord, who will punish him with awful punishment!<?php break;}
case 88:{?>But as for him who believeth and doeth right, good will be his reward, and We shall speak unto him a mild command.<?php break;}
case 89:{?>Then he followed a road<?php break;}
case 90:{?>Till, when he reached the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had appointed no helper therefrom.<?php break;}
case 91:{?>So ( it was ). And We knew all concerning him.<?php break;}
case 92:{?>Then he followed a road<?php break;}
case 93:{?>Till, when he came between the two mountains, he found upon their hither side a folk that scarce could understand a saying.<?php break;}
case 94:{?>They said : O Dhul-Qarneyn! Lo! Gog and Magog are spoiling the land. So may we pay thee tribute on condition that thou set a barrier between us and them?<?php break;}
case 95:{?>He said : That wherein my Lord hath established me better ( than your tribute ). Do but help me with strength ( of men ), I will set between you and them a bank.<?php break;}
case 96:{?>Give me pieces of iron till, when he had levelled up ( the gap ) between the cliffs, he said : Blow! till, when he had made it a fire, he said : Bring me molten copper to pour thereon.<?php break;}
case 97:{?>And ( Gog and Magog ) were not able to surmount, nor could they pierce ( it ).<?php break;}
case 98:{?>He said : This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord cometh to pass, He will lay it low, for the promise of my Lord is true.<?php break;}
case 99:{?>And on that day We shall let some of them surge against others, and the Trumpet will be blown. Then We shall gather them together in one gathering.<?php break;}
case 100:{?>On that day We shall present hell to the disbelievers, plain to view,<?php break;}
case 101:{?>Those whose eyes were hoodwinked from My reminder, and who could not bear to hear.<?php break;}
case 102:{?>Do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose My bondmen as protecting friends beside Me? Lo! We have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers.<?php break;}
case 103:{?>Say : Shall We inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works?<?php break;}
case 104:{?>Those whose effort goeth astray in the life of the world, and yet they reckon that they do good work.<?php break;}
case 105:{?>Those are they who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord and in the meeting with Him. Therefor their works are vain, and on the Day of Resurrection We assign no weight to them.<?php break;}
case 106:{?>That is their reward : hell, because they disbelieved, and made a jest of Our revelations and Our messengers.<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Lo! those who believe and do good works, theirs are the Gardens of Paradise, for welcome,<?php break;}
case 108:{?>Wherein they will abide, with no desire to be removed from thence.<?php break;}
case 109:{?>Say : Though the sea became ink for the Words of my Lord, verily the sea would be used up before the Words of my Lord were exhausted, even though We brought the like thereof to help.<?php break;}
case 110:{?>Say : I am only a mortal like you. My Lord inspireth in me that your God is only One God. And whoever hopeth for the meeting with his Lord, let him do righteous work, and make none sharer of the worship due unto his Lord.<?php break;}
