case 3:{?>It may be that thou tormentest thyself ( O Muhammad ) because they believe not.<?php break;}
case 4:{?>If We will, We can send down on them from the sky a portent so that their necks would remain bowed before it.<?php break;}
case 5:{?>Never cometh there unto them a fresh reminder from the Beneficent One, but they turn away from it.<?php break;}
case 6:{?>Now they have denied ( the Truth ); but there will come unto them tidings of that whereat they used to scoff.<?php break;}
case 7:{?>Have they not seen the earth, how much of every fruitful kind We make to grow therein?<?php break;}
case 8:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 9:{?>And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 10:{?>And when thy Lord called Moses, saying : Go unto the wrongdoing folk,<?php break;}
case 11:{?>The folk of Pharaoh. Will they not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 12:{?>He said : My Lord! Lo! I fear that they will deny me,<?php break;}
case 13:{?>And I shall be embarrassed, and my tongue will not speak plainly, therefor send for Aaron ( to help me ).<?php break;}
case 14:{?>And they have a crime against me, so I fear that they will kill me.<?php break;}
case 15:{?>He said : Nay, verily. So go ye twain with Our tokens. Lo! We shall be with you, Hearing.<?php break;}
case 16:{?>And come together unto Pharaoh and say : Lo! we bear a message of the Lord of the Worlds,<?php break;}
case 17:{?>( Saying ) : Let the Children of Israel go with Us.<?php break;}
case 18:{?>( Pharaoh ) said ( unto Moses ) : Did we not rear thee among us as a child? And thou didst dwell many years of thy life among us,<?php break;}
case 19:{?>And thou didst that thy deed which thou didst, and thou wast one of the ingrates,<?php break;}
case 20:{?>He said : I did it then, when I was of those who are astray.<?php break;}
case 21:{?>Then I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord vouchsafed me a command and appointed me ( of the number ) of those sent ( by Him ).<?php break;}
case 22:{?>And this is the past favor wherewith thou reproachest me : that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel.<?php break;}
case 23:{?>Pharaoh said : And what is the Lord of the Worlds?<?php break;}
case 24:{?>( Moses ) said : Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief.<?php break;}
case 25:{?>( Pharaoh ) said unto those around him : Hear ye not?<?php break;}
case 26:{?>He said : Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers.<?php break;}
case 27:{?>( Pharaoh ) said : Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!<?php break;}
case 28:{?>He said : Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand.<?php break;}
case 29:{?>( Pharaoh ) said : If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners.<?php break;}
case 30:{?>He said : Even though I show thee something plain?<?php break;}
case 31:{?>( Pharaoh ) said : Produce it then, if thou art of the truthful!<?php break;}
case 32:{?>Then he Sung down his staff and it became a serpent manifest,<?php break;}
case 33:{?>And he drew forth his hand and lo! it was white to the beholders.<?php break;}
case 34:{?>( Pharaoh ) said unto the chiefs about him : Lo, this is verily a knowing wizard,<?php break;}
case 35:{?>Who would drive you out of your land by his magic. Now what counsel ye?<?php break;}
case 36:{?>They said : Put him off, ( him ) and his brother, and send them into the cities summoners<?php break;}
case 37:{?>Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard.<?php break;}
case 38:{?>So the wizards were gathered together at a set time on a day appointed.<?php break;}
case 39:{?>And it was said unto the people : Are ye ( also ) gathering?<?php break;}
case 40:{?>( They said ) : Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners.<?php break;}
case 41:{?>And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh : Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners?<?php break;}
case 42:{?>He said : Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near ( to me ).<?php break;}
case 43:{?>Moses said unto them : Throw what ye are going to throw!<?php break;}
case 44:{?>Then they threw down their cords and their staves and said : By Pharaoh ' s might, lo! we verily are the winners.<?php break;}
case 45:{?>Then Moses threw his staff and lo! it swallowed that which they did falsely show.<?php break;}
case 46:{?>And the wizards were flung prostrate,<?php break;}
case 47:{?>Crying : We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,<?php break;}
case 48:{?>The Lord of Moses and Aaron.<?php break;}
case 49:{?>( Pharaoh ) said, Ye put your faith in him before I give you leave. Lo! he doubtless is your chief who taught you magic! But verily ye shall come to know. Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you everyone.<?php break;}
case 50:{?>They said : It is no hurt, for lo! unto our Lord we shall return.<?php break;}
case 51:{?>Lo! we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we are the first of the believers.<?php break;}
case 52:{?>And We inspired Moses, saying : Take away My slaves by night, for ye will be pursued.<?php break;}
case 53:{?>Then Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners,<?php break;}
case 54:{?>( Who said ) : Lo! these indeed are but a little troop,<?php break;}
case 55:{?>And lo! they are offenders against us.<?php break;}
case 56:{?>And lo! we are a ready host.<?php break;}
case 57:{?>Thus did We take them away from gardens and water springs,<?php break;}
case 58:{?>And treasures and a fair estate.<?php break;}
case 59:{?>Thus ( were those things taken from them ) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.<?php break;}
case 60:{?>And they overtook them at sunrise.<?php break;}
case 61:{?>And when the two hosts saw each other, those with Moses said : Lo! we are indeed caught.<?php break;}
case 62:{?>He said : Nay, verily! for lo! my Lord is with me. He will guide me.<?php break;}
case 63:{?>Then We inspired Moses, saying : Smite the sea with thy staff. And it parted, and each part was as a mountain vast.<?php break;}
case 64:{?>Then brought We near the others to that place.<?php break;}
case 65:{?>And We saved Moses and those with him, every one;<?php break;}
case 66:{?>We drowned the others.<?php break;}
case 67:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 68:{?>And lo, thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 69:{?>Recite unto them the story of Abraham :<?php break;}
case 70:{?>When he said unto his father and his folk : What worship ye?<?php break;}
case 71:{?>They said : We worship idols, and are ever devoted unto them.<?php break;}
case 72:{?>He said : Do they hear you when ye cry?<?php break;}
case 73:{?>Or do they benefit or harm you?<?php break;}
case 74:{?>They said : Nay, but we found our fathers acting on this use.<?php break;}
case 75:{?>He said : See now that which ye worship,<?php break;}
case 76:{?>Ye and your forefathers!<?php break;}
case 77:{?>Lo! they are ( all ) an enemy unto me, save the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 78:{?>Who created me, and He doth guide me,<?php break;}
case 79:{?>And Who feedeth me and watereth me.<?php break;}
case 80:{?>And when I sicken, then He healeth me,<?php break;}
case 81:{?>And Who causeth me to die, the giveth me life ( again ),<?php break;}
case 82:{?>And Who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgement.<?php break;}
case 83:{?>My Lord! Vouchsafe me wisdom and unite me to the righteous.<?php break;}
case 84:{?>And give unto me a good report in later generations.<?php break;}
case 85:{?>And place me among the inheritors of the Garden of Delight,<?php break;}
case 86:{?>And forgive my father. Lo! he is of those who err.<?php break;}
case 87:{?>And abase me not on the day when they are raised,<?php break;}
case 88:{?>The day when wealth and sons avail not ( any man )<?php break;}
case 89:{?>Save him who bringeth unto Allah a whole heart.<?php break;}
case 90:{?>And the Garden will be brought nigh for those who ward off ( evil ).<?php break;}
case 91:{?>And hell will appear plainly to the erring.<?php break;}
case 92:{?>And it will be said unto them : Where is ( all ) that ye used to worship<?php break;}
case 93:{?>Instead of Allah? Can they help you or help themselves?<?php break;}
case 94:{?>Then they will be hurled therein, they and the seducers<?php break;}
case 95:{?>And the hosts of Iblis, together.<?php break;}
case 96:{?>And they will say, when they are quarrelling therein :<?php break;}
case 97:{?>By Allah, of a truth we were in error manifest<?php break;}
case 98:{?>When we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 99:{?>It was but the guilty who misled us.<?php break;}
case 100:{?>Now we have no intercessors<?php break;}
case 101:{?>Nor any loving friend.<?php break;}
case 102:{?>Oh, that we had another turn ( on earth ), that we might be of the believers!<?php break;}
case 103:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers!<?php break;}
case 104:{?>And lo, thy Lord! He is Indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 105:{?>Noah ' s folk denied the messengers ( of Allah ),<?php break;}
case 106:{?>When their brother Noah said unto them : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 107:{?>Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<?php break;}
case 108:{?>So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<?php break;}
case 109:{?>And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 110:{?>So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<?php break;}
case 111:{?>They said : Shall we put faith in thee, when the lowest ( of the people ) follow thee?<?php break;}
case 112:{?>He said : And what knowledge have I of what they may have been doing ( in the past )?<?php break;}
case 113:{?>Lo! their reckoning is my Lord ' s concern, if ye but knew;<?php break;}
case 114:{?>And I am not ( here ) to repulse believers.<?php break;}
case 115:{?>I am only a plain warner.<?php break;}
case 116:{?>They said : If thou cease not, O Noah, thou wilt surely be among those stoned ( to death ).<?php break;}
case 117:{?>He said : My Lord! Lo! my own folk deny me.<?php break;}
case 118:{?>Therefor judge Thou between us, a ( conclusive ) judgment, and save me and those believers who are with me.<?php break;}
case 119:{?>And We saved him and those with him in the laden ship.<?php break;}
case 120:{?>Then afterward We drowned the others.<?php break;}
case 121:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 122:{?>And lo, thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 123:{?>( The tribe of ) Aad denied the messengers ( of Allah ),<?php break;}
case 124:{?>When their brother Hud said unto them : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 125:{?>Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<?php break;}
case 126:{?>So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<?php break;}
case 127:{?>And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 128:{?>Build ye on every high place a monument for vain delight?<?php break;}
case 129:{?>And seek ye out strongholds, that haply ye may last for ever?<?php break;}
case 130:{?>And if ye seize by force, seize ye as tyrants?<?php break;}
case 131:{?>Rather keep your duty to Allah, and obey me.<?php break;}
case 132:{?>Keep your duty toward Him who hath aided you with ( the good things ) that ye know,<?php break;}
case 133:{?>Hath aided you with cattle and sons.<?php break;}
case 134:{?>And gardens and watersprings.<?php break;}
case 135:{?>Lo! I fear for you the retribution of an awful day.<?php break;}
case 136:{?>They said : It is all one to us whether thou preachest or art not of those who preach;<?php break;}
case 137:{?>This is but a fable of the men of old,<?php break;}
case 138:{?>And we shall not be doomed.<?php break;}
case 139:{?>And they denied him; therefor We destroyed them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 140:{?>And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 141:{?>( The tribe of ) Thamud denied the messengers ( of Allah )<?php break;}
case 142:{?>When their brother Salih said unto them : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 143:{?>Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<?php break;}
case 144:{?>So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<?php break;}
case 145:{?>And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 146:{?>Will ye be left secure in that which is here before us,<?php break;}
case 147:{?>In gardens and watersprings<?php break;}
case 148:{?>And tilled fields and heavy sheathed palm trees,<?php break;}
case 149:{?>Though ye hew out dwellings in the mountain, being skilful?<?php break;}
case 150:{?>Therefor keep your duty to Allah and obey me,<?php break;}
case 151:{?>And obey not the command of the prodigal,<?php break;}
case 152:{?>Who spread corruption in the earth, and reform not.<?php break;}
case 153:{?>They said : Thou art but one of the bewitched;<?php break;}
case 154:{?>Thou art but a mortal like us. So bring some token if thou art of the truthful.<?php break;}
case 155:{?>He said : ( Behold ) this she camel. She hath the right to drink ( at the well ), and ye have the right to drink, ( each ) on an appointed day.<?php break;}
case 156:{?>And touch her not with ill lest there come on you the retribution of an awful day.<?php break;}
case 157:{?>But they hamstrung her, and then were penitent.<?php break;}
case 158:{?>So the retribution came on them. Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 159:{?>And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 160:{?>The folk of Lot denied the messengers ( of Allah ),<?php break;}
case 161:{?>When their brother Lot said unto them : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 162:{?>Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<?php break;}
case 163:{?>So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<?php break;}
case 164:{?>And I ask of you no wage therefor; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 165:{?>What! Of all creatures do ye come unto the males,<?php break;}
case 166:{?>And leave the wives your Lord created for you? Nay, but ye are froward folk.<?php break;}
case 167:{?>They said : If thou cease not, O Lot, thou wilt soon be of the outcast.<?php break;}
case 168:{?>He said : I am in truth of those who hate your conduct.<?php break;}
case 169:{?>My Lord! Save me and my household from what they do.<?php break;}
case 170:{?>So We saved him and his household, every one,<?php break;}
case 171:{?>Save an old woman among those who stayed behind.<?php break;}
case 172:{?>Then afterward We destroyed the others.<?php break;}
case 173:{?>And We rained on them a rain. And dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned.<?php break;}
case 174:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent, yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 175:{?>And lo! thy Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 176:{?>The dwellers in the wood ( of Midian ) denied the messengers ( of Allah ),<?php break;}
case 177:{?>When Shueyb said unto them : Will ye not ward off ( evil )?<?php break;}
case 178:{?>Lo! I am a faithful messenger unto you,<?php break;}
case 179:{?>So keep your duty to Allah and obey me.<?php break;}
case 180:{?>And I ask of you no wage for it; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds.<?php break;}
case 181:{?>Give full measure, and be not of those who give less ( than the due ).<?php break;}
case 182:{?>And weigh with the true balance.<?php break;}
case 183:{?>Wring not mankind in their goods, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth.<?php break;}
case 184:{?>And keep your duty unto Him Who created you and the generations of the men of old.<?php break;}
case 185:{?>They said : Thou art but one of the bewitched;<?php break;}
case 186:{?>Thou art but a mortal like us, and lo! we deem thee of the liars.<?php break;}
case 187:{?>Then make fragments of the heaven fall upon us, if thou art of the truthful.<?php break;}
case 188:{?>He said : My Lord is best aware of what ye do.<?php break;}
case 189:{?>But they denied him, so there came on them the retribution of the day of gloom. Lo! it was the retribution of an awful day.<?php break;}
case 190:{?>Lo! herein is indeed a portent; yet most of them are not believers.<?php break;}
case 191:{?>And lo! thy Lord! He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 192:{?>And lo! it is a revelation of the Lord of the Worlds,<?php break;}
case 193:{?>Which the True Spirit hath brought down<?php break;}
case 194:{?>Upon thy heart, that thou mayest be ( one ) of the warners,<?php break;}
case 195:{?>In plain Arabic speech.<?php break;}
case 196:{?>And lo, it is in the Scriptures of the men of old.<?php break;}
case 197:{?>Is it not a token for them that the doctors of the Children of Israel know it?<?php break;}
case 198:{?>And if We had revealed it unto one of any other nation than the Arabs,<?php break;}
case 199:{?>And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed in it.<?php break;}
case 200:{?>Thus do We make it traverse the hearts of the guilty.<?php break;}
case 201:{?>They will not believe in it till they behold the painful doom,<?php break;}
case 202:{?>So that it will come upon them suddenly, when they perceive not.<?php break;}
case 203:{?>Then they will say : Are we to be reprieved?<?php break;}
case 204:{?>Would they ( now ) hasten on Our doom?<?php break;}
case 205:{?>Hast thou then seen, We content them for ( long ) years,<?php break;}
case 206:{?>And then cometh that which they were promised,<?php break;}
case 207:{?>( How ) that wherewith they were contented naught availeth them?<?php break;}
case 208:{?>And We destroyed no township but it had its warners<?php break;}
case 209:{?>For reminder, for We never were oppressors.<?php break;}
case 210:{?>The devils did not bring it down.<?php break;}
case 211:{?>It is not meet for them, nor is it in their power,<?php break;}
case 212:{?>Lo! verily they are banished from the hearing.<?php break;}
case 213:{?>Therefor invoke not with Allah another god, lest thou be one of the doomed.<?php break;}
case 214:{?>And warn thy tribe of near kindred,<?php break;}
case 215:{?>And lower thy wing ( in kindness ) unto those believers who follow thee.<?php break;}
case 216:{?>And if they ( thy kinsfolk ) disobey thee, say : Lo! I am innocent of what they do.<?php break;}
case 217:{?>And put thy trust in the Mighty, the Merciful.<?php break;}
case 218:{?>Who seeth thee when thou standest up ( to pray )<?php break;}
case 219:{?>And ( seeth ) thine abasement among those who fall prostrate ( in worship ).<?php break;}
case 220:{?>Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower.<?php break;}
case 221:{?>Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend?<?php break;}
case 222:{?>They descend on every sinful, false one.<?php break;}
case 223:{?>They listen eagerly, but most of them are liars.<?php break;}
case 224:{?>As for poets, the erring follow them.<?php break;}
case 225:{?>Hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley,<?php break;}
case 226:{?>And how they say that which they do not?<?php break;}
case 227:{?>Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and vindicate themselves after they have been wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know by what a ( great ) reverse they will be overturned!<?php break;}
