	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
Last year, I got a chance to join a student exchange program to Bima regency, Nusa Tenggara Barat. I flew there with four other students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We arrived at Bima&amp;rsquo;s airport at two in the afternoon. A boy, named Fahriel, had been waiting for us. His father accompanied him. We continued our journey to Sape village where Fahriel and his family live. It was a busy village on the tip of the Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During my visit, I had a lot of activities. In the morning, I came to Fahriel&amp;rsquo;s school and joined his school activities. In the afternoon I did many activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the &amp;#64257;rst week, I went to the beaches. Bima have many beautiful beaches. They are clean and have white sand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the second Week, I joined camping activities. It was a great fun. Besides having scouting activities, my friends and I also had dancing and singing perfonnance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In our last week We spent our time Watching horse race, catching &amp;#64257;sh in karamba, and learning how to weave Bimanese Traditional Cloth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though I just spend a month in Bima, I realized that I have fallen in love with the beauty of its nature and unique custom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
Last year, I got a chance to join a student exchange program to Bima regency, Nusa Tenggara Barat. I flew there with four other students.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We arrived at Bima&amp;rsquo;s airport at two in the afternoon. A boy, named Fahriel, had been waiting for us. His father accompanied him. We continued our journey to Sape village where Fahriel and his family live. It was a busy village on the tip of the Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During my visit, I had a lot of activities. In the morning, I came to Fahriel&amp;rsquo;s school and joined his school activities. In the afternoon I did many activities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the &amp;#64257;rst week, I went to the beaches. Bima have many beautiful beaches. They are clean and have white sand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the second Week, I joined camping activities. It was a great fun. Besides having scouting activities, my friends and I also had dancing and singing perfonnance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In our last week We spent our time Watching horse race, catching &amp;#64257;sh in karamba, and learning how to weave Bimanese Traditional Cloth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Though I just spend a month in Bima, I realized that I have fallen in love with the beauty of its nature and unique custom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text for question.&lt;br&gt;
Camellia Sinensis is an evergreen tea plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Nevertheless, some varieties can tolerate marine climates as they are cultivated far north in Pembrokeshire of the British mainland and Washington in the United States.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tea plants are propagated from seed or by cutting. It takes approximately 4 to 12 years for tea plant to a bear seed, and it needs 3 years before a new plant is ready for harvesting. In a warm climate tea plants require at least 127 cm (50 inches) of rainfall a year. Traditional Chinese Tea Cultivation and Studies believes that high quality tea plants are cultivated at elevations of up to 1,500 meter. At these heights, the plants grow slower.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The parts of tea plant which is harvested are the top 1-2 inches of the mature plant. These buds and leaves are called flushes. The tea plant will grow a new flush every seven tofteen days during the growing season. Leaves that are slow in development always produce better &amp;#64258;avored teas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A tea plant will grow into a tree of up to 16 meter if left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are pruned to waist height for ease plucking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

One day while a mousedeer was walking in the forest, he saw a big black snake sleeping under the tree. When he saw the snake, the mousedeer was frightened. He wanted to run away from the snake, but suddenly he fell on top of a tiger which was sleeping not far from the snake. The tiger woke up and took hold of the mousedeer. He told the mousedeer that he was going to make him food for his lunch.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t eat me now&amp;rdquo;, said the mousedeer.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rdquo;I have something important to do&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;rdquo;Look&amp;rdquo;, said the mousedeer while pointing at the snake. &amp;ldquo;That is the king&amp;rsquo;s belt. He asked me to stay here and watch over it while he was away in the forest. The tiger looked at the snake and said, &amp;ldquo;That is a beautiful belt. I need a belt like that. Can I wear it?&amp;rdquo; he asked the mousedeer.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh all right&amp;rdquo; said the mousedeer. So he picked up the snake and wound the belt around the tiger. Then the snake woke up and saw the tiger. The snake twisted itself tighter and tighter until the tiger couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe. The tiger asked the mousedeer to help him. But the mousedeer had ran away into the forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&amp;rdquo;Look&amp;rdquo;, said the mousedeer while pointing at the snake. &amp;ldquo;That is the king&amp;rsquo;s belt. He asked me to stay here and watch over it while he was away in the forest. The tiger looked at the snake and said, &amp;ldquo;That is a beautiful belt. I need a belt like that. Can I wear it?&amp;rdquo; he asked the mousedeer.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh all right&amp;rdquo; said the mousedeer. So he picked up the snake and wound the belt around the tiger. Then the snake woke up and saw the tiger. The snake twisted itself tighter and tighter until the tiger couldn&amp;rsquo;t breathe. The tiger asked the mousedeer to help him. But the mousedeer had ran away into the forest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Once upon a time. there was a kingdom in Java that was attacked by another kingdom. The king asked his Queen to save her life. Alas! ln the middle of the jungle, the enemy killed all her guards. However, the Queen was lucky because she changed herself into a golden snail and survived.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One day, an old woman saw the snail and took it home. She looked after it. Whenever the old woman was not at home, the snail turned into a human being. She cooked and did the household chores. When the old woman got home, the Queen quickly changed into a snail again. It happened several times and made the old woman curious. One day, the old woman peeped and saw What was going on. She broke in, immediately. She asked, &amp;ldquo;Why did you change yourself into a snail?&amp;rdquo;. The Queen told her what happened. The old woman was surprised to know that the snail was a Queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Later, from the head of the village they discovered that the king had won the battle and he was looking for his Wife. Then the village head sent a message to the king telling him that his wife was safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
