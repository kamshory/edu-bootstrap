	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Ojek &quot;motorcycle taxi&quot; began appearing in Jakarta after becak was banned in 1994. Ojek service began as a people's initiative to provide an alternative transportation for people who used becak from main roads into housing complexes.&lt;br&gt;
There is no government license or control for ojek. By the law, all motorcycle passengers should wear helmet so ojek drivers should have a spare for their passengers to wear. Ojek tends to congregate at t-junctions on main roads and near smaller roads that are not serviced by bus routes.&lt;br&gt;
Ladies should have a careful position in taking ojek. Also, if the women wear a dress, they have to sit sidewise on the back of the vehicle. You have to bargain before you get on and ask a local people about the usual price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In ancient times, the king placed a boulder on a roadway. Then he hid and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.&lt;br&gt;
Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything to get the big stone out of the ways. Then a peasant came along, carrying a load of vegetables. On approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After lots of pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying on the road where the boulder had been.&lt;br&gt;
The purse contained a lot of gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many others never understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

On approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After lots of pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. As the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying on the road where the boulder had been.&lt;br&gt;
The purse contained a lot of gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many others never understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What can we learn from the story?&lt;/p&gt;</text>

Picasso was one of the most outstanding and important artists of the 1900's. He was best known for his paintings. Almost every style in modern art was represented in Picasso's works.&lt;br&gt;
Picasso was born in 1881 in Malaga, Spain, as the son of an art teacher. He studied painting with his father and also in Madrid.&lt;br&gt;
From 1895 to 1901, he painted realistic works in a traditional style. Then he entered what was called the Blue period. During this time, he only used shades of blue in his paintings to show poverty in Barcelona.&lt;br&gt;

Dear Mely,&lt;br&gt;
I'm sorry, I haven't written for so long. My family and I have just returned from an interesting holiday at Lake Maninjau near Padang. The lake was a crater surrounded by densed forests and rice fields. We swam in the lake, ate fish from the lake, and enjoyed the cool breezes.&lt;br&gt;
After that, we had a two hour trip to Bukit Tinggi, a small hill top town which was clean, cool, and friendly.&lt;br&gt;
Our trip around the hill took us to the coffee, clove, and cinnamon plantation. The traditional Minangkabau houses, with the roof shaped like a buffalo's horn can be seen everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
I really enjoy my vacation. Do come over and have a look sometime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most interesting places to visit is the Bird Park. It is located in the industrial area in Singapore, called Jurong. The bird park is about twelve kilometers from the centre of the city, and it's easy to get there by bus or by taxi.&lt;br&gt;
It is one of the largest bird park in the world. The birds are kept in large cages, and there are hundreds of beautiful birds from many different parts of the world, including penguins, parrots, eagles, and ostriches. There is a large lake in the park with a restaurant beside it. There is also a very large cage which you can walk in to get a closer look at the birds.&lt;br&gt;
It takes about two hours to see all the birds. You can walk around the park or ride on a bus. The best time to visit the park is in the early morning or late afternoon, when it is cooler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most interesting places to visit is the Bird Park. It is located in the industrial area in Singapore, called Jurong. The bird park is about twelve kilometers from the centre of the city, and it's easy to get there by bus or by taxi.&lt;br&gt;
It is one of the largest bird park in the world. The birds are kept in large cages, and there are hundreds of beautiful birds from many different parts of the world, including penguins, parrots, eagles, and ostriches. There is a large lake in the park with a restaurant beside it. There is also a very large cage which you can walk in to get a closer look at the birds.&lt;br&gt;
It takes about two hours to see all the birds. You can walk around the park or ride on a bus. The best time to visit the park is in the early morning or late afternoon, when it is cooler.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Why do many people like to visit the bird park late in the afternoon?&lt;/p&gt;</text>

A man and his son were going to the market. While they were walking, a country man passed and said, &quot;You fool, what a donkey for but to ride upon?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
So the man put the boy on the donkey. But soon, some passersby said, &quot;See that lazy, young steer. He lets his father walk while he rides.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
So the man ordered his boy to get off and got on himself, but the passerby said, &quot;Shame on... that lazy old man, he lets his poor son walk, while he rides.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The man did not know what to do. Last, he took his boy on the donkey. Then the passerby said, &quot;Aren't you ashamed of yourself for overloading the poor donkey?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
The man and the boy got off. They cut down a pole, tied the donkey's feet to it and raised the pole to their shoulders. They arrived to a bridge when the donkey, getting one of its feet loose, kick all out and caused the boy to drop his end of the pole. In the struggle, the donkey fell over the&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia plants are popular for the strong sweet scent of their flowers.&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia is the national flower in Pakistan. In japan and China, the flower is called Kuchinashi (Japanese) and Thi zi (Chinese).&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia plants are evergreen shrubs. Their small trees can grow to 1 - 5 meters tall. The leaves are 5 - 50 centimeters long and 3 - 25 centimeters broad, dark green, and glossy with a leathery texture. The flowers are in small groups, white, or pale yellow, with 5 - 12 lobes (petals) from 5 - 12 centimeters diameter. They usually bloom in mid-spring to mid-summer. Many species have strong aroma.&lt;br&gt;
To cultivate gardenia as a house plant is not easy. This species can be difficult to grow because it originated in warm humid tropical areas. It demands high humidity and bright (not direct) light to thrive. It flourishes in acidic soil with good drainage and thrives on 20&amp;deg; - 23&amp;deg; C during the day and 15&amp;deg; - 16&amp;deg;C in the evening. Potting soils developed specifically for gardenias are available. It grows no larger than 18 inches in height and width when grown indoor. In climates where it can be grown outdoors, it can reach the height of 6 feet. If water hits the flowers, they will turn brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia plants are popular for the strong sweet scent of their flowers.&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia is the national flower in Pakistan. In japan and China, the flower is called Kuchinashi (Japanese) and Thi zi (Chinese).&lt;br&gt;
Gardenia plants are evergreen shrubs. Their small trees can grow to 1 - 5 meters tall. The leaves are 5 - 50 centimeters long and 3 - 25 centimeters broad, dark green, and glossy with a leathery texture. The flowers are in small groups, white, or pale yellow, with 5 - 12 lobes (petals) from 5 - 12 centimeters diameter. They usually bloom in mid-spring to mid-summer. Many species have strong aroma.&lt;br&gt;
To cultivate gardenia as a house plant is not easy. This species can be difficult to grow because it originated in warm humid tropical areas. It demands high humidity and bright (not direct) light to thrive. It flourishes in acidic soil with good drainage and thrives on 20&amp;deg; - 23&amp;deg; C during the day and 15&amp;deg; - 16&amp;deg;C in the evening. Potting soils developed specifically for gardenias are available. It grows no larger than 18 inches in height and width when grown indoor. In climates where it can be grown outdoors, it can reach the height of 6 feet. If water hits the flowers, they will turn brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
