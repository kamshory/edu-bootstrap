	<text>&lt;p&gt;DILI (AP): A strong earthquake struck off the coast of East Timor on Wednesday, prompting authorities to issue a tsunami warning - but no large waves hit the tiny nation's coast.&lt;br&gt;The 6.2 magnitude tremor struck 262 kilometers northeast of the capital. Dili. in Indonesia's Banda Sea at a depth of 10 kilometers, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Residents in Dili did not feel any shaking and there were no immediate reports of damage of injuries.&lt;br&gt;Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency issued a tsunami alert. saying it had been powerful enough to generate giant waves. The waming was later retracted. East Timor. a colony abandoned by the Portuguese that became Asia's youngest country after breaking from Indonesia in 1999. sits along a series of fault lines and volcanoes known as the Paci&amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;c Ring of Fire.&lt;br&gt;In December 2004. a massive earthquake struck off Indonesia's Sumatra and triggered a tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in a dozen countries, including 160,000 people in Indonesia's western of province of Aceh.&lt;br&gt;Which of the following statements is true based on the text?&lt;/p&gt;</text>

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Faraday studied the magnetic &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;eld around a conductor canying a DC electric current. While conducting these studies, Faraday established the basis for the electromagnetic &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;eld concept in physics, subsequently enlarged upon by James Maxwell. He similarly discovered electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and laws of electrolysis. He established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became viable for use in technology.&lt;br&gt;As a chemist. Michael Faraday discovered benzene, investigated the clathrate hydrate of chlorine. invented an early fonn of the Bunsen bumer and the system of oxidation numbers, and popularized tenninology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion.&lt;br&gt;Although Faraday received little formal education and knew little of higher mathematics, such as calculus, he was one of the most in&amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#130;uential scientists in history. Historians of science refer to him as the best experimentalist in the history of science. The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named a&amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#130;er him, as is the Faraday constant, the charge on a mole of electrons (about 96,485 coulombs). Faraday's law of induction states that magnetic &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#130;ux changing in time creates a proportional electromotive force. &lt;br&gt;Faraday was the &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;rst and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a position to which he was appointed for life.&lt;br&gt;Albert Einstein kept a photograph of Faraday on his study wall alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell.&lt;br&gt;Faraday was highly religious. He was a member of the Sandemanian Church, a Christian sect founded in 1730 that demanded total faith and commitment.

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Ant-eaters are perhaps the most curious looking animals.&lt;br&gt;Their long head and snout look like tubes, and they have no teeth at all. Their front legs are very strong and armed with heavy curved claws with which they break open the nets of ants and temiites and then, when the insects rush out, use their long. sticky tongues to lick them up at great speed.&lt;br&gt;True ant-eaters are found in the swamps and forests of central and South America. Scaly ant-eaters, or pangolins. are found in Africa and tropical Asia. &lt;br&gt;Various other insect-eating animals are sometimes called ant-eaters. although they really belong to other groups of animals. One of them is the ant-bear, which lives on the plains of South and Central Africa. This has long. erect ears but short blunt claws, an almost hairless tail. yellow brown in color.

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;Human body is made up of countless millions of cells. Food is needed to built up new cells and replace the worn out cells. However, the food that we take must be changed into substances that can be carried in the blood to the places where they are needed. This process is called digestion.&lt;br&gt;The &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;rst digestive process takes place in the mouth. The food we eat is broken up into small pieces by the action of teeth. mixed with saliva, a juice secreted by glands in the mouth. Saliva contains digestive juices which moisten the food, so it can be swallowed easily.&lt;br&gt;From the mouth, food passes through the esophagus (the food passage) into the stomach. Here, the food is mixed with the juices secreted by the cells in the stomach for several hours. Then the food enters the small intestine. All the time the muscular walls of the intestine are squeezing. mixing and moving the food onwards.&lt;br&gt;In a few hours, the food changes into acids. These are soon absorbed by the villi (microscopic branch projections from the intestine walls) and passed into the bloodstream.&lt;br&gt;What is the text about?&lt;/p&gt;</text>

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Faraday studied the magnetic &amp;#64257;eld around a conductor canying a DC electric current. While conducting these studies, Faraday established the basis for the electromagnetic &amp;#64257;eld concept in physics, subsequently enlarged upon by James Maxwell. He similarly discovered electromagnetic induction, diamagnetism, and laws of electrolysis. He established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became viable for use in technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As a chemist. Michael Faraday discovered benzene, investigated the clathrate hydrate of chlorine. invented an early fonn of the Bunsen bumer and the system of oxidation numbers, and popularized tenninology such as anode, cathode, electrode, and ion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although Faraday received little formal education and knew little of higher mathematics, such as calculus, he was one of the most in&amp;#64258;uential scientists in history. Historians of science refer to him as the best experimentalist in the history of science. The SI unit of capacitance, the farad, is named a&amp;#64258;er him, as is the Faraday constant, the charge on a mole of electrons (about 96,485 coulombs). Faraday's law of induction states that magnetic &amp;#64258;ux changing in time creates a proportional electromotive force. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Faraday was the &amp;#64257;rst and foremost Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain, a position to which he was appointed for life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Albert Einstein kept a photograph of Faraday on his study wall alongside pictures of Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Faraday was highly religious. He was a member of the Sandemanian Church, a Christian sect founded in 1730 that demanded total faith and commitment. Biographers have noted that a strong sense of the unity of God and nature pervaded Faraday&amp;lsquo;s life and work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Ant-eaters are perhaps the most curious looking animals.Their long head and snout look like tubes, and they have no teeth at all. Their front legs are very strong and armed with heavy curved claws with which they break open the nets of ants and temiites and then, when the insects rush out, use their long. sticky tongues to lick them up at great speed.True ant-eaters are found in the swamps and forests of central and South America. Scaly ant-eaters, or pangolins. are found in Africa and tropical Asia. Various other insect-eating animals are sometimes called ant-eaters. although they really belong to other groups of animals. One of them is the ant-bear, which lives on the plains of South and Central Africa. This has long. erect ears but short blunt claws, an almost hairless tail. yellow brown in color.

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Human body is made up of countless millions of cells. Food is needed to built up new cells and replace the worn out cells. However, the food that we take must be changed into substances that can be carried in the blood to the places where they are needed. This process is called digestion.The &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;rst digestive process takes place in the mouth. The food we eat is broken up into small pieces by the action of teeth. mixed with saliva, a juice secreted by glands in the mouth. Saliva contains digestive juices which moisten the food, so it can be swallowed easily.From the mouth, food passes through the esophagus (the food passage) into the stomach. Here, the food is mixed with the juices secreted by the cells in the stomach for several hours. Then the food enters the small intestine. All the time the muscular walls of the intestine are squeezing. mixing and moving the food onwards.In a few hours, the food changes into acids.

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Govemment should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price like last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, govemment should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation's own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.&lt;/p&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;Human body is made up of countless millions of cells. Food is needed to built up new cells and replace the worn out cells. However, the food that we take must be changed into substances that can be carried in the blood to the places where they are needed. This process is called digestion.The &amp;iuml;&amp;not;&amp;#129;rst digestive process takes place in the mouth. The food we eat is broken up into small pieces by the action of teeth. mixed with saliva, a juice secreted by glands in the mouth. Saliva contains digestive juices which moisten the food, so it can be swallowed easily.From the mouth, food passes through the esophagus (the food passage) into the stomach. Here, the food is mixed with the juices secreted by the cells in the stomach for several hours. Then the food enters the small intestine. All the time the muscular walls of the intestine are squeezing. mixing and moving the food onwards.In a few hours, the food changes into acids. These are soon absorbed by the villi (microscopic branch projections from the intestine walls) and passed into the bloodstream&quot;Human body is made up of countless millions of cells.&quot; (Paragraph 1)Made up means&lt;/p&gt;</text>
