Personnel Manager&lt;br&gt;
Wong And Lim Consulting&lt;br&gt;
PO Box 583&lt;br&gt;
Kwai Chung&lt;br&gt;
Kowloon&lt;br&gt;
Dear Mr. Chan,&lt;br&gt;
I am writing to apply for the post of Management Trainee, which was advertised on the Student Affairs Office notice board of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University on 17 December 2015.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My working experience at Lucky Star Garment Manufactory Limited improved my leadership skills, communication skills and ability to work in a team environment. I have fluent spoken and written English. I also have fluent spoken and written Mandarin, and can therefore work in mainland China.&lt;br&gt;
Currently I am studying a B.A. in Management at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, graduating in 2016. Subjects which I am studying that are relevant to the post of Management Trainee include Operations Management, Human Resources Management, Accounting, Marketing and Strategic Management.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My final year project is entitled Knowledge Management Practices in HK. Carrying out this project has improved my communication skills, my leadership skills and my ability to lead and supervise subordinates effectively. I have also learned how to run a project from the planning stage to its completion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
During my studies I have held the post of Executive in the Management Society. While leading and organising Management Society activities I have improved my ability to lead and supervise subordinates effectively, ability to work under pressure and ability to work in a team environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Working for Wong And Lim Consulting appeals to me because it has a good reputation and it provides excellent training. Your organization produces a high-quality service, and I can contribute to this with my leadership skills and my ability to work under pressure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I am available for interview at any time. I can be contacted most easily on the mobile phone (08158030837). I look forward to meeting you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yours sincerely&lt;br&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
How to Improve Scores on Writing and Speaking in IELTS&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Writing&lt;br&gt;
1.	Write correct and simple sentences is just not enough. Try to use different word if you have use the same word over and over.&lt;br&gt;
2.	Punctuation is very important in achieving the score you hope to. Before attempting writing exercises it is better to refresh you basic knowledge in things like punctuation.&lt;br&gt;
3.	It is good to keep sentences short as it helps to express the ideas more clearly.&lt;br&gt;
4.	Practice makes perfect. Get good study material and go through the given examples to familiarize your self with the patter of the exam.&lt;br&gt;
Speaking&lt;br&gt;
1.	Realize that this has lot to do with your own ability to speak English. If you are not able to clearly speak, the best thing is to listen to day-to-day English conversations .you may be able listen to radio, TV or may be to read dialogues written in English.&lt;br&gt;
2.	Remember to answer the question asked, in order to do this you need to listen to the examiner carefully. For example, if the examiner asks you to talk about food in your country, just don't start to talk about the diet your people take. But you can talk about cuisine when talking about food.&lt;br&gt;
3.	If you have a friend who has done IELTS, get that friend to practice few topics given for exam. Ask the friend to be the examiner and you be the candidate, keep lot of practice sessions and speak on different topics, keeping to what is asked.&lt;br&gt;
4.	Speak as normal as you can, as if you are talking to some body in your day today life. Use lots of different words, and remember to use expressions.&lt;br&gt;
5.	Relax when you speak, don't fill the gaps with ellipses. Just keeping a little gap between your words is ok, but practice to be fluent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
About 500 ancient masks from many regions across Indonesia are being displayed at the Sonobudoyo Museum in Yogyakarta from Nov. 20 to 29.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The event, called The Power of Topeng (The Power of the Mask), presents 400 masks that are simulacrums of statues from all over the country and the other masks that are from the collection of the Sonobudoyo Museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The curator of the event, I Wayan Dana, said that based on Indonesian history, masks not only functioned as works of art, but also as instruments of religious rituals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The two functions strengthen the mask's position as having strong roots in Indonesian cultures,&amp;rdquo; he said when speaking at the event's opening ceremony on Thursday night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In religious rituals, he said, masks were used as instruments to communicate with supernatural powers, while their shapes were adjusted to the traditions in each era. He added that the masks also developed side by side with the changes of kingdoms in this archipelago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Van Heekeren, the author of Prehistoric Life of Indonesia, published in 1955, noted that masks had been parts of Indonesian prehistory thousands of years ago. The Mask of Panji, which developed during the Majapahit Kingdom, for example, told a love story in the era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Other examples are the Ramayana Mask, which was developed during the Indonesian Hindu kingdoms, and the Ngayogyakarta Palace Mask that was made during the era of Hamengkubuwono VII.&lt;br&gt;
The head of Yogyakarta Culture Agency, Umat Priyono, expressed his appreciation to the organizers of the event with the hope that it would widen people&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the development of masks as a cultural product in Indonesia. &lt;br&gt;

The event, called The Power of Topeng (The Power of the Mask), presents 400 masks that are simulacrums of statues from all over the country and the other masks that are from the collection of the Sonobudoyo Museum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The curator of the event, I Wayan Dana, said that based on Indonesian history, masks not only functioned as works of art, but also as instruments of religious rituals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The two functions strengthen the mask's position as having strong roots in Indonesian cultures,&amp;rdquo; he said when speaking at the event's opening ceremony on Thursday night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In religious rituals, he said, masks were used as instruments to communicate with supernatural powers, while their shapes were adjusted to the traditions in each era. He added that the masks also developed side by side with the changes of kingdoms in this archipelago.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Van Heekeren, the author of Prehistoric Life of Indonesia, published in 1955, noted that masks had been parts of Indonesian prehistory thousands of years ago. The Mask of Panji, which developed during the Majapahit Kingdom, for example, told a love story in the era.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Other examples are the Ramayana Mask, which was developed during the Indonesian Hindu kingdoms, and the Ngayogyakarta Palace Mask that was made during the era of Hamengkubuwono VII.&lt;br&gt;
The head of Yogyakarta Culture Agency, Umat Priyono, expressed his appreciation to the organizers of the event with the hope that it would widen people&amp;rsquo;s understanding of the development of masks as a cultural product in Indonesia. &lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;The following text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
The government will announce a decrease in the prices of subsidized fuel after a Cabinet meeting held in the State Palace this afternoon, according to Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Sudirman Said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;There will be a Cabinet meeting in the afternoon; [the cuts] will be announced later,&quot; Sudirman Said in Jakarta on Wednesday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He explained the new prices will take effect on Jan. 5 to give gas stations time to prepare, including by selling their current stocks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;It needs a transition to avoid chaos. So perhaps the new prices will be effective on Jan. 5,&quot; he add.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Currently, the price of subsidized premium gasoline outside of Java, Madura and Bali is Rp 7,300 (49 US cents) per liter, subsidized diesel is Rp 6,700 per liter and kerosene is Rp 2,500 per liter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Earlier, the director general of oil and gas, I Gusti Nyoman Wiratmadja Puja, said the government will cut the price of Premium by Rp 200 to Rp 300 per liter, while subsidized diesel will go down by more than Rp 500 in January 2016.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Referring to Energy and Mineral Resources Ministerial Regulation No. 4/2015, the government evaluates fuel prices every three months based on the latest update of the benchmark price. &lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
The early 1600s saw the beginning of a great tide of emigration from Europe to North America. Spanning more than three centuries, this movement grew from a trickle of a few hundred English colonists to a flood of millions of newcomers. Impelled by powerful and diverse motivations, they built a new civilization on the northern part of the continent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first English immigrants to what is now the United States crossed the Atlantic long after thriving Spanish colonies had been established in Mexico, the West Indies and South America. Like all early travelers to the New World, they came in small, overcrowded ships. During their six- to 12-week voyages, they lived on meager rations. Many died of disease; ships were often battered by storms and some were lost at sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most European emigrants left their homelands to escape political oppression, to seek the freedom to practice their religion, or for adventure and opportunities denied them at home. Between 1620 and 1635, economic difficulties swept England. Many people could not find work. Even skilled artisans could earn little more than a bare living. Poor crop yields added to the distress. In addition, the Industrial Revolution had created a burgeoning textile industry, which demanded an ever-increasing supply of wool to keep the looms running. Landlords enclosed farmlands and evicted the peasants in favor of sheep cultivation. Colonial expansion became an outlet for this displaced peasant population.&lt;br&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
Cheating is the getting of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, cronyism, sleaze, nepotism and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to marital infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a cheat in British English, and a cheater in American English. A person described as a &quot;cheat&quot; doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on unfair tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Academic cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 70% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 60% say they have plagiarized papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by Rutgers University professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a Gallup survey. In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, &quot;74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated.&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating - cite_note-3 The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to educators, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating - cite_note-4and camera phones are used to send pictures of tests; MP3 players can hold digitalized notes; graphing calculators store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;br&gt;

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
Cheating is the getting of a reward for ability or finding an easy way out of an unpleasant situation by dishonest means. It is generally used for the breaking of rules to gain unfair advantage in a competitive situation. This broad definition will necessarily include acts of bribery, cronyism, sleaze, nepotism and any situation where individuals are given preference using inappropriate criteria. The rules infringed may be explicit, or they may be from an unwritten code of conduct based on morality, ethics or custom, making the identification of cheating conduct a potentially subjective process. Cheating can refer specifically to marital infidelity. Someone who is known for cheating is referred to as a cheat in British English, and a cheater in American English. A person described as a &quot;cheat&quot; doesn't necessarily cheat all the time, but rather, relies on unfair tactics to the point of acquiring a reputation for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Academic cheating is a significantly common occurrence in high schools and colleges in the United States. Statistically, 70% of public high school students admit to serious test cheating. 60% say they have plagiarized papers. Only 50% of private school students, however, admit to this. The report was made in June 2005 by Rutgers University professor Donald McCabe for The Center for Academic Integrity. The findings were corroborated in part by a Gallup survey. In McCabe's 2001 of 4500 high school students, &quot;74% said they cheated on a test, 72% cheated on a written work, and 97% reported to at least had copied someone's homework or peeked at someone's test. 1/3 reported to have repeatedly cheated.&quot; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating - cite_note-3 The new revolution in high-tech digital info contributes enormously to the new wave in cheating: online term-paper mills sell formatted reports on practically any topic; services exist to prepare any kind of homework or take online tests for students, despite the fact that this phenomenon, and these websites, are well known to educators, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheating - cite_note-4and camera phones are used to send pictures of tests; MP3 players can hold digitalized notes; graphing calculators store formulas to solve math problems.&lt;br&gt;

	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt; Ecommerce has become so popular and profitable. This article tells about some advantages of online shopping that attract both shoppers and online shop owners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The vast majority of online stores offer prices that are much lower than what you will find at a physical store. There are a few reasons for this. The first is because many people use the Internet to find cheaper items. Online business owners understand this. They will usually reduce their profit margin to get more customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Another reason is because you can easily browse through dozens of different websites to find the best price. You can do the same at a mall, but it would take about an hour or longer. You also may not be taxed because most ecommerce stores won&amp;rsquo;t tax you unless they are stationed in your state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The other advantage of shopping online is convenient. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to get dressed and drive to your favorite store. You can easily visit their website, find the product you want and buy it without getting out of your pajamas. It&amp;rsquo;s also convenient because you don&amp;rsquo;t need to wait for the store to open.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; These three above reasons makes online shopping get higher in demand. It is common sense for buyers to have better prices, convenience, and variety while shopping.

	<question>
	<text>&lt;p&gt;This text is for question.&lt;br&gt;
Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel at 7&amp;ndash;10 cm (2.8&amp;ndash;3.9 in) in length and just 10 g (0.35 oz) in weight, to the Alpine marmot, which is 53&amp;ndash;73 cm (21&amp;ndash;29 in) long and weighs from 5 to 8 kg (11 to 18 lb). Squirrels typically have slender bodies with bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, although much thicker in some species than others. The color of squirrels is highly variable between&amp;mdash;and often even within&amp;mdash;species. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In general, the hind limbs are longer than the fore limbs, and they have four or five toes on each paw. Their paws include an often poorly developed thumb, and have soft pads on the undersides.[6] Unlike most mammals, Tree squirrels can descend a tree head-first. They do so by rotating their ankles 180 degrees so the hind paws are backward-pointing and can grip the tree bark. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Squirrels live in almost every habitat from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert, avoiding only the high polar regions and the driest of deserts. They are predominantly herbivorous, subsisting on seeds and nuts, but many will eat insects and even small vertebrates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As their large eyes indicate, in general squirrels have an excellent sense of vision, which is especially important for tree-dwelling species. They also have very versatile and sturdy claws for grasping and climbing. Many also have a good sense of touch, with vibrissae on their heads and limbs.&lt;br&gt;
